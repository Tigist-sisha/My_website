       <h2 class="subheader">Background</h2>
          <p> I am a student at Year Up majoring in software development QA testing. Although I am studying software development, I am passionate about risk assessment and management as well as expanding my technical knowledge in addition to having an intrinsic desire to break something that has yet to be broken. I will be using Year as a steppingstone into the Cyber Security Industry since I have already obtained my general associates in high school.
Currently, I am taking Coursera courses in Python and Pearl, and a AWS cloud computing course, as well as my Year Up classes to further my knowledge and experience. I am also working on small projects on GitHub individually and collaboratively. Apart from school, I am also the co-founder of RIYAC which is a non-profit organization, and volunteer full time at my local mosque. 
After I graduate Year Up, I aim to become a software developer and then go to Seattle University to obtain my bachelorâ€™s in computer science, Where I can then climb up the corporate ladder and provide opportunities to the upcoming underrepresented generation and work on closing the opportunity divide gap in STEM for young girls and women like myself.
Besides school, I do enjoy reading, photography, and digital art. I believe to stay true to the goals I have set for myself I must allow myself to make time for what I enjoy most.</p>
